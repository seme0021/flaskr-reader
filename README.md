# flaskr-redis

A Flask and Redis powered reading aplication. The redis database is available upon request, but will not be commited to the public repo.

## Dependencies 

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)   
- [Redis](http://redis.io/)   

## Installation

## Documentation
I built this project based on this [prior work](https://github.com/fyears/flaskr-redis) by fyears.
I chose to use redis for this project for scalability and the ability to distribute the database accross mulitple servers.
